CECS 424  Assignment 7

Write a recursive method, fib, that computes the Nth Fibonacci number. The 
formulas are
f(0) = 1, f(1) =1, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

Write a method, fib3, that returns a tuple contained fib(N) computed three 
times.

Write a function loop() which is an entry point for a process.  When it 
receives a tuple of a process id and parameter N from a process it sends back 
a tuple of its own process id and fib(N) to that process.

Write a method con(N) that spawns three processes each with entry point the 
loop method.  It sends each of these processes a tuple with its process id and 
the argument N.  It receives the tuples from the three processes and returns a 
tuple with the three fib(N) values.

Compare the time of the fib3 function with that of the con function using the 
timer:tc(module, function, list of parameters) method.  The first element of 
the return value will be the time in microseconds. The second element will be 
the tuple of three computations of the same Fibonacci number.  A value of N 
between 25 and 35 should give a good comparison depending on the hardware.

If you have a multicore machine you will see a difference in performance.
